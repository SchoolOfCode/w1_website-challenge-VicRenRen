My client Merlin said he likes old school pages like the ones from MySpace days, hes into mushrooms and technology.
This was the biggest influence behind my design choices.
We both gave each other loads of freedom to experiment with HTML and CSS.
Unfortunately I didnt play enough with Flex so it wasnt included much.
At this stage my website only works with my screen resolution.
